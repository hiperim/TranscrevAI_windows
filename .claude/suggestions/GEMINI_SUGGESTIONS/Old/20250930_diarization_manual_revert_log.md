# Diarization Module Manual Revert Log (2025-09-30)

This document details the steps taken to manually revert `src/diarization.py` to its MFCC-based implementation, as requested by the user.

## 1. Initial Assessment

- **Goal:** Revert `src/diarization.py` to its state *before* any speaker embedding integration (Resemblyzer or SpeechBrain x-vectors).
- **Constraint:** Previous project state not saved on Git; reliance on documentation files and conversation history.
- **Reference Files:** `20250930_comprehensive_project_changes.md`, `SPRINT3_V2_CHANGES.md`.

## 2. Revert Steps Performed

### 2.1 `requirements.txt`
- **Action:** Attempted to remove `resemblyzer` dependency.
- **Outcome:** `resemblyzer` was already absent from `requirements.txt`. (Confirmed by `read_file` output).
- **Action:** Removed `speechbrain` dependency, which was an unexpected addition.
- **Outcome:** `speechbrain` successfully removed.

### 2.2 `src/diarization.py` - `__init__` method and `_get_xvector_model`
- **Action:** Reverted the `__init__` method to its MFCC-based state and removed the `_get_xvector_model` method.
- **Outcome:** Successful. The `__init__` method now reflects the state described in `20250930_comprehensive_project_changes.md` (section 4.3) before speaker embedding integration.

### 2.3 `src/diarization.py` - `_calculate_confidence_scores` method
- **Action:** Reverted `cosine_distances` back to `euclidean_distances` for distance calculation.
- **Outcome:** Successful.

### 2.4 `src/diarization.py` - `_clustering_diarization` method
- **Action:** Intended to restore MFCC extraction, scaling, AgglomerativeClustering parameters, and segment creation logic.
- **Outcome:** Upon inspection of the current file content, it was found that the `_clustering_diarization` method was *already in the desired MFCC-based state*. The previous `replace` operations to integrate speaker embeddings into `_clustering_diarization` (Resemblyzer or SpeechBrain x-vectors) must have failed or been reverted by other means.
    - **Current State Confirmed:**
        - MFCC extraction (`n_mfcc=20`, delta, delta2, 60D features).
        - MFCC Hop Length (`0.010 * sr` for 50% overlap).
        - Normalization (`RobustScaler` for short audio, `StandardScaler` for normal audio).
        - Agglomerative Clustering (`linkage='ward'`, `metric='euclidean'`).
        - `frame_duration` based segment creation logic.

### 2.5 `src/diarization.py` - `_extract_speaker_embedding` method
- **Action:** Intended to remove this method.
- **Outcome:** The method was already absent from the file. (Confirmed by `replace` tool output).

### 2.6 `src/diarization.py` - `LazyVoiceEncoder` class and instantiation
- **Action:** Intended to remove the `LazyVoiceEncoder` class and its instantiation in `CPUSpeakerDiarization.__init__`.
- **Outcome:** The class and its instantiation were already absent from the file. (Confirmed by `replace` tool output).

## 3. Conclusion of Revert

`src/diarization.py` has been successfully reverted to its MFCC-based implementation, reflecting the state before any speaker embedding integration attempts in this session. The `requirements.txt` file has also been cleaned of `speechbrain`.
