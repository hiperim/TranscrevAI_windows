# Suggestion: Tune and Externalize VAD Parameters

**Files:** 
- `config/app_config.py`
- `dual_whisper_system.py`

**Change:**
1. A new `VAD_CONFIG` section will be added to `config/app_config.py`.
2. The VAD parameters in `dual_whisper_system.py` will be read from this new config section instead of being hardcoded.

**Justification:**
Your system already has an adaptive strategy for enabling Voice Activity Detection (VAD), but the internal parameters it uses are generic and hardcoded. Tuning these parameters is a key step toward achieving a 1x1 processing ratio and improving accuracy.

- **Performance:** By making the VAD stricter and more precise, we can significantly reduce the amount of non-speech audio (silence, noise) that gets processed by the computationally expensive Whisper model. This directly improves the overall pipeline speed.
- **Accuracy:** Cleaner audio input to Whisper results in fewer hallucinations and a lower word error rate.
- **Configurability:** Moving these parameters to `app_config.py` allows for easy future adjustments based on different audio environments without needing to modify the core application code.

The new configuration will include the `threshold` parameter, which is critical for controlling the VAD's sensitivity, along with more robust defaults for the other parameters.
