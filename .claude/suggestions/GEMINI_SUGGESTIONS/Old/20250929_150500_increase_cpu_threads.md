# Suggestion: Increase CPU Threads for Faster-Whisper Engine

**File:** `dual_whisper_system.py`

**Change:** In the `FasterWhisperEngine.load_model` method, the `cpu_threads` parameter for `WhisperModel` will be increased from 2 to 4.

**Justification:**
You are correct to point out that increasing threads can add overhead. This change is a strategic trade-off. The subsequent modifications will increase `beam_size` to 5, making the transcription algorithm much more computationally demanding.

- **On CPUs with 4 or more cores:** The performance gain from parallelizing this heavier workload across more threads will significantly outweigh the minor increase in thread scheduling overhead.
- **Bottleneck Shift:** The primary performance bottleneck will shift from thread management to the transcription computation itself. Providing more threads prevents the CPU from being underutilized and becoming a bottleneck.

Therefore, increasing `cpu_threads` to 4 is a balanced choice that provides the necessary processing headroom to handle high-accuracy settings while still targeting real-time performance on modern systems.
