# Modifications to `src/performance_optimizer.py`

This document outlines the modifications made to `src/performance_optimizer.py` as part of the code cleanup and bug fixing process.

## Deprecated Code and Logic Removal:

1.  **Removed Legacy Aliases for `ResourceManager`:**
    *   The following functions, explicitly marked as "Legacy alias for backwards compatibility," were removed:
        *   `get_unified_resource_controller()`
        *   `get_unified_controller()`
        *   `get_memory_monitor()`
    *   **Reasoning:** These aliases were no longer necessary and contributed to code clutter. Call sites should now directly use `get_resource_manager()`.

2.  **Removed Commented-Out LLM Post-processing Code:**
    *   The commented lines related to "LLM post-processing removed in FASE 5.0," including imports for `POST_PROCESSING_CONFIG` and `correct_transcription_with_llm`, were removed.
    *   **Reasoning:** This feature was explicitly removed, and the commented-out code served no purpose other than clutter.

3.  **Removed Legacy Aliases for `ConcurrentSessionManager`:**
    *   The following compatibility aliases were removed:
        *   `get_concurrent_session_manager()`
        *   `ConcurrentSessionManager = MultiProcessingTranscrevAI`
    *   **Reasoning:** These aliases were for backward compatibility and are no longer needed, simplifying the codebase.

4.  **Removed Duplicated `_wait_for_diarization_result` Method:**
    *   A duplicate definition of the `_wait_for_diarization_result` method was found and removed. The correct implementation remains.
    *   **Reasoning:** Redundant code.

5.  **Removed Duplicated `_send_audio_command`, `_send_transcription_command`, and `_send_diarization_command` Methods:**
    *   Duplicate definitions of these asynchronous command-sending methods were found and removed. The correct implementations remain.
    *   **Reasoning:** Redundant code.

## Bug Fixes and Code Improvements:

1.  **Fixed Unreachable `return False` in `QueueManager.get_control_message`:**
    *   The line `return False` immediately following `return None` in the `except queue.Empty` block was removed.
    *   **Reasoning:** The `return False` was unreachable code and indicated a potential logical error or oversight. The correct behavior for an empty queue after a timeout is to return `None`.

2.  **Fixed Unreachable `return False` in `QueueManager.get_status_update`:**
    *   Similar to `get_control_message`, the unreachable `return False` was removed from the `except queue.Empty` block.
    *   **Reasoning:** Same as above.

3.  **Fixed Unreachable `return False` in `SharedMemoryManager.check_process_isolation_compliance`:**
    *   The line `return False` immediately following `return True` in the `except (psutil.NoSuchProcess, KeyError)` block was removed.
    *   **Reasoning:** If a process does not exist (`NoSuchProcess`), it cannot be non-compliant due to memory usage. Returning `True` (indicating compliance or irrelevance to memory limits) is the correct logical flow.

## Pending Actions:

*   **Improve exception handling for `queue.Full` in `_send_audio_command`:** This was attempted but failed due to `replace` tool matching issues. This will be addressed by manually replacing the entire method if necessary.
*   **Review `diarization_worker`'s `asyncio.run` in `ThreadPoolExecutor`:** Investigate the pattern and ensure robustness.
*   **Review `_handle_audio_websocket_message`'s session ID lookup:** Assess potential fragility if `websocket_manager` is not unique per session.
*   **Remove `audio_input_type` and `audio_type` legacy parameters:** Investigate usage and remove if unused.
