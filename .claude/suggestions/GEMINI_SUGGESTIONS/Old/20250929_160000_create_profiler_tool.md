# Suggestion: Create a Comprehensive Performance Profiler

**File:** `dev_tools/profiler.py` (New file)

**Change:**
Create a new script that will serve as a powerful diagnostic tool to analyze the entire transcription and diarization pipeline. The profiler will measure three key areas:

1.  **Execution Time:** Using Python's built-in `cProfile`, it will generate a detailed report showing which functions are taking the most time to execute.
2.  **Memory Usage:** Using the `memory-profiler` library, it will provide a line-by-line analysis of memory consumption to identify any memory-hungry operations.
3.  **System Resources:** Using `psutil`, it will log overall CPU and memory usage throughout the profiling session to understand the application's impact on the system.

**Justification:**
To achieve our 1x1 processing goal, we must first adopt a data-driven approach. Making blind optimizations is inefficient. This profiler will give us the precise data needed to identify the exact bottlenecks in the current implementation.

- **Targeted Optimization:** Instead of guessing, we will know exactly which parts of the code to focus on for the most significant performance gains.
- **Evidence-Based Decisions:** All future optimizations will be based on the concrete evidence provided by this tool.
- **Holistic View:** By measuring time, memory, and resources simultaneously, we get a complete understanding of the application's performance characteristics, ensuring that an optimization in one area doesn't negatively impact another.

This is the foundational step for a methodical and effective performance tuning process.
