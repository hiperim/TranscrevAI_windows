# Suggestion: Fix Syntax Error and Dependency Conflicts

**Files:**
- `dual_whisper_system.py`
- `requirements.txt`

**Change 1: Fix Syntax Error**
In `dual_whisper_system.py`, a `logger.info` call contains an f-string with improperly escaped quotes, causing a `SyntaxError`. This will be corrected by using double quotes for the string literal.

**Change 2: Resolve Dependency Conflicts**
The `requirements.txt` file pins `torch` and `torchaudio` to version `2.1.0`. However, other key dependencies like `pyannote-audio` require version `2.2.0` or newer. This causes a conflict that, while not the cause of the current crash, will lead to future runtime errors.

To resolve this, the versions for `torch` and `torchaudio` in `requirements.txt` will be upgraded to `2.2.0`.

**Justification:**
These changes are necessary to create a stable and runnable environment for the application. 

- Fixing the `SyntaxError` is a direct bug fix.
- Resolving the dependency conflicts proactively prevents future runtime errors and ensures all packages in the environment are compatible with each other, which is essential for a stable application.
