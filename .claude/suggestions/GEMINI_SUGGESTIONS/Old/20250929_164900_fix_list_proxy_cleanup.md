# Fix: ListProxy Cleanup Error

**File:** `src/performance_optimizer.py`

**Change:** In the `SharedMemoryManager.cleanup` method, the `.clear()` method call on `mp.Manager().list()` objects (which are `ListProxy` objects) was replaced with `[:] = []`.

**Justification:**
The `ListProxy` objects returned by `multiprocessing.Manager().list()` do not have a `.clear()` method. Attempting to call `.clear()` on them results in an `AttributeError` during the cleanup phase of the application shutdown.

Replacing `.clear()` with the slice assignment `[:] = []` is the correct and idiomatic way to clear the contents of a `ListProxy` object, ensuring that shared memory buffers are properly reset during cleanup without causing runtime errors.
