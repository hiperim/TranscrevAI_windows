# Suggestion: Tune Faster-Whisper for High Accuracy

**File:** `dual_whisper_system.py`

**Change:** In the `FasterWhisperEngine.transcribe` method, the parameters for `self.model.transcribe` will be updated as follows:
- `beam_size` increased from 1 to 5.
- `best_of` increased from 1 to 5.
- `word_timestamps` changed from `False` to `True`.

**Justification:**
The previous parameters were optimized for maximum speed, which resulted in lower accuracy. This change rebalances the system to prioritize high-quality transcriptions.

- **`beam_size=5`**: This is the most critical change for accuracy. It enables beam search, allowing the model to explore multiple potential transcription paths and select the most likely sequence, rather than just picking the next best word (greedy decoding).
- **`best_of=5`**: This works with `beam_size` to further refine the output by considering more candidates, reducing the risk of errors.
- **`word_timestamps=True`**: Enabling this provides the necessary data for generating precise, word-level subtitles, which is a key feature for a high-quality transcription service. The performance impact is manageable with `faster-whisper`.

These changes, combined with the increased `cpu_threads`, aim to deliver a significantly more accurate transcription while leveraging the performance of `faster-whisper` to maintain a near real-time processing ratio.
