# Suggestion: Fix Critical Runtime Errors in Multiprocessing Pipeline

**Files:**
- `src/performance_optimizer.py`
- `src/transcription.py`

**Changes:**
This document outlines fixes for several critical runtime errors encountered during profiling, ensuring the multiprocessing pipeline functions correctly.

1.  **Fix `AttributeError: 'MultiProcessingTranscrevAI' object has no attribute 'session_results'`:**
    *   **Problem:** The `_wait_for_transcription_result` method attempts to access `self.session_results`, which is not initialized. Results are intended to be passed via `SharedMemoryManager` buffers.
    *   **Solution:** Refactor `_wait_for_transcription_result` to correctly poll `self.shared_memory.transcription_buffer` for the specific session's result. The `transcription_worker` will be updated to place its results into this buffer.

2.  **Fix `OptimizedTranscriber.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'model_name'`:**
    *   **Problem:** The `transcription_worker` initializes `OptimizedTranscriber` with `model_name="medium"`, but `OptimizedTranscriber.__init__` does not accept this argument.
    *   **Solution:** Remove the `model_name` argument from the `OptimizedTranscriber` initialization in the `transcription_worker`, as the model loading is handled internally by `TranscriptionService`.

3.  **Fix `UnicodeEncodeError` in Logging:**
    *   **Problem:** A `logger.info` call in `MultiProcessingTranscrevAI.__init__` uses an emoji that causes an `UnicodeEncodeError` on consoles not configured for UTF-8.
    *   **Solution:** Remove the emoji from the logging message to ensure compatibility across different console environments.

4.  **Fix `ListProxy' object has no attribute 'clear'`:**
    *   **Problem:** The `SharedMemoryManager.cleanup` method attempts to call `.clear()` on `mp.Manager().list()` objects, which are `ListProxy` objects and do not have this method.
    *   **Solution:** Replace `.clear()` with `[:] = []` to correctly clear the contents of the `ListProxy` objects.

**Justification:**
These fixes are essential for the stability and functionality of the multiprocessing pipeline. Without them, the profiler (and the application itself) cannot run correctly. Addressing these bugs will allow us to proceed with accurate performance profiling and subsequent optimizations.
