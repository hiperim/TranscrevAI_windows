##### PROMPT: "I've completed the analysis of src/ files, main.py, and
  config/app_config.py, compiling a prioritized list of findings for a
  production-ready app with no deprecated logic.


  Easiest to Fix (Low Difficulty):
  1.  src/__init__.py: No issues.
  2.  src/logging_setup.py: No significant bugs.
  3.  src/subtitle_generator.py: Add explicit type hints for
  segments list elements in generate_srt.
  4.  src/model_parameters.py: Verify patience: None and
  length_penalty: None in PHASE1_OPTIMIZED_PARAMS.
  5.  src/diarization.py: Remove unused import cosine_distances.
  6.  src/diarization.py: Redundant duration = len(audio_data) / sr
  in _clustering_diarization.
  7.  src/diarization.py: Misleading comment in
  _clustering_diarization about x-vector.
  8.  src/transcription.py: TranscriptionResult.metadata is unused.
  9.  src/transcription.py: _apply_ptbr_corrections is a
  placeholder.
  10. src/transcription.py: _calculate_confidence is a placeholder.
  11. src/transcription.py: TranscriptionService._track_performance
  is a placeholder.
  12. src/transcription.py: Model unload/reload integration with
  MODEL_UNLOAD_DELAY needs verification.
  13. config/app_config.py: Historical comments (FASE 10, SPRINT 3)
  could be cleaned up.
  14. config/app_config.py: PROCESSING_CONFIG has fixed
  whisper_beam_size and whisper_patience.
  15. config/app_config.py: DIARIZATION_CONFIG.min_speakers is 1.
  16. src/file_manager.py: sanitize_path is a top-level function.


  Medium Difficulty to Fix:
  1.  src/audio_processing.py: RobustAudioLoader class is defined but
   appears unused.
  2.  src/audio_processing.py: torchaudio is directly imported in
  some methods, but also lazy-loaded.
  3.  src/file_manager.py: IntelligentModelLoader and
  IntelligentCacheManager are architecturally misplaced.
  4.  src/file_manager.py: IntelligentModelLoader has TODO: Implement
   model loading logic.
  5.  src/file_manager.py: IntelligentModelLoader mentions deprecated
   transcription_fase8.
  6.  src/file_manager.py: IntelligentModelLoader has restricted
  language support.
  7.  src/file_manager.py: IntelligentCacheManager has specific
  "browser safety" and "401MB compliance" comments.
  8.  src/file_manager.py: cleanup_temp_dirs method's check might be
  overly complex.
  9.  src/performance_optimizer.py: process_with_shared_memory is a
  top-level function.
  10. src/performance_optimizer.py: _transcription_worker and
  _diarization_worker are top-level functions with tight coupling.
  11. src/performance_optimizer.py: _get_available_cores might
  misreport CPU count in containers.
  12. src/performance_optimizer.py: Tight coupling of worker
  functions with DualWhisperSystem and CPUSpeakerDiarization.
  13. src/performance_optimizer.py: ProcessType enum could be in its
  own file.
  14. src/diarization.py: Unused methods _cluster_speakers_improved
  and _reassign_noise_points.
  15. src/diarization.py: _spectral_diarization falls back to
  _clustering_diarization.
  16. src/transcription.py: FasterWhisperEngine.transcribe - TODO:
  Implement adaptive beam search.
  17. src/transcription.py: FasterWhisperEngine.transcribe - TODO:
  Implement dynamic prompt selection.
  18. src/transcription.py: FasterWhisperEngine.transcribe - TODO:
  Implement VAD filtering.
  19. src/transcription.py: OpenAIWhisperINT8Engine fallback might be
   less optimized.
  20. main.py: Remnants of old functionality (simple_model_manager,
  ONNX-related comments).
  21. main.py: multiprocessing_enabled flag logic needs review.
  22. main.py: _check_memory_before_processing logic needs to be
  robust.
  23. main.py: _process_audio_with_multiprocessing needs robust error
   handling and resource management.
  24. config/app_config.py: WHISPER_MODEL_PATH comment is outdated.
  25. config/app_config.py: DIARIZATION_CONFIG.analysis_thresholds
  has "REVERTED" comments.

  Hardest to Fix (High Difficulty):
  1.  src/diarization.py: Hardcoded estimated_speakers in
  _simple_diarization.
  2.  src/diarization.py: Review _pattern_based_fallback and
  _create_fallback_segments logic."

I need you to analyze currently attached files from present state of my app Transcrevai.
I need to address all these issues stated above, trace a plan to effectively fix and implement the necessary code modifications, list what you agree with and what you don't. Make thorough web searches if needed.

Transcrevai is supposed to be a fast and reliable transcription and diarization service, with audio processing from live recordings and audio files uploaded by user. It's supposed to work efficiently, without errors, bugs or inconsistencies.

I want the app to be fully functional after your analyzis and modifications, with all implementations and features working 100%, no pylance errors, bugs or inconsistencies on code.

3-way review all your suggestions, and deliver all modified files 100% updated and with complete code. 

Do not implement new features on project, work with what we already have, making the necessary updates, fixes, and modifications on code so the app gets improved and fixed. If needed, thoroughly make web searches to deliver the best and most accurate implementations/answers possible.
