# Enhanced Claude Agent - Strategic MCP Integration with Large Codebase Analysis for TranscrevAI
*Optimized for efficient Gemini research + Claude implementation with advanced codebase analysis capabilities*

## Core Strategy: Maximize Gemini Context + Strategic Claude Implementation

This approach leverages **Gemini's massive context window for codebase analysis** and **100 free daily requests** for web research and validation, while using **Claude's paid tokens** exclusively for complex code implementation and architecture decisions. The **Triple Resume Strategy** prevents token waste on complex implementations.

## Enhanced Large Codebase Analysis Strategy

### Large Context Analysis with Gemini CLI
**When analyzing large codebases or multiple files that might exceed context limits or spend significant tokens on analysis:**

```bash
# Use Gemini CLI with massive context window
gemini -p "@src/whisper_onnx_manager.py @src/audio_processing.py @src/main.py Analyze integration between these components for [specific issue]. Provide architectural overview and key interaction points."

# For entire codebase analysis
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ @tests/ Complete codebase analysis for [problem domain]. Identify architectural patterns, dependencies, and potential improvement areas."

# For performance bottleneck analysis
gemini -p "@src/performance_critical_files.py What are the performance bottlenecks in this codebase? Rank them by impact and provide optimization suggestions."
```

**Benefits:**
- **Massive Context**: Handles entire codebases without truncation
- **Free Analysis**: No paid tokens spent on large file analysis  
- **Architecture Insights**: Holistic view of system interactions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring patterns and anti-patterns

### Triple Resume Strategy for Complex Implementations
**For high-complexity implementations that could consume significant tokens:**

#### Step 1: Ask for 3 Different Summaries
```bash
# Summary 1: Focus on specific file/component
gemini -p "@src/target_file.py Analyze [problem] and give brief summary of fixes needed. Focus on this specific component."

# Summary 2: Focus on multiple related files
gemini -p "@src/file1.py @src/file2.py @src/file3.py What causes [problem] across these related files? Brief plan for coordinated fixes."

# Summary 3: Focus on architecture/system-wide approach
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ Overall architectural approach to solve [problem]. High-level implementation strategy and system changes needed."
```

#### Step 2: Compare Consistency & Validation
```bash
# Validate findings across summaries
gemini -p "Compare these three approaches to solving [problem]: [paste summaries]. Which approach is most robust and sustainable? What are the tradeoffs?"
```

**Consistency Decision Matrix:**
- **All 3 summaries align**: Proceed with high confidence implementation
- **2/3 summaries align**: Use majority approach, note dissenting view
- **All 3 summaries differ**: **STOP** - Ask user for guidance, something is architecturally unclear

#### Step 3: Implementation Decision Framework
```bash
# Final validation before Claude implementation
gemini -p "Based on codebase analysis, validate this implementation approach: [chosen approach]. Check for compliance with existing patterns and potential issues."
```

**Decision Criteria:**
- **Architectural Consistency**: Aligns with existing codebase patterns
- **Sustainability**: Long-term maintainability and extensibility  
- **Compliance**: Follows compliance.txt and system requirements
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies potential failure modes

## Phase 1: Strategic Gemini Research (Enhanced with Large Context)
*Leverage Gemini's massive context window and web search capabilities*

### Step 1.1: Performance Analysis with Codebase Context
**Gemini Large Context Research**
```bash
# Analyze current performance with full codebase context
gemini -p "@src/ Current TranscrevAI codebase performance bottlenecks. Which components need optimization for target deployment environment?"

# Web research with context
gemini search "Machine learning inference optimization benchmarks 2025"
gemini search "Python multiprocessing audio processing optimization patterns"

# Validate findings against codebase
gemini -p "@src/whisper_onnx_manager.py @src/audio_processing.py How do current implementations align with performance optimization best practices found in research?"
```

### Step 1.2: Model Optimization Architecture Analysis
**Gemini Optimization Research with Codebase Context**
```bash
# Analyze current model optimization implementation
gemini -p "@src/model_converter.py @src/whisper_onnx_manager.py Current model optimization implementation analysis. What improvements are needed?"

# Research current best practices
gemini search "ML model quantization optimization techniques 2025"
gemini search "Neural network memory optimization strategies"

# Validate implementation approach
gemini -p "@src/ How should model optimization be integrated with current codebase architecture? Identify integration points."
```

### Step 1.3: System Compatibility Analysis
**Gemini Compatibility Research with Codebase Context**
```bash
# Analyze current compatibility implementation
gemini -p "@src/gpu_provider_manager.py @src/hybrid_model_manager.py Current compatibility implementation analysis. Coverage assessment needed."

# Research alternative approaches
gemini search "Cross-platform ML deployment compatibility 2025"
gemini search "Hardware abstraction patterns machine learning"

# Validate hybrid approach
gemini -p "@src/ Validate system compatibility approach. Are there architectural gaps or potential issues?"
```

---

## Phase 2: Claude Implementation Focus (Triple Resume Strategy)
*Use Claude exclusively for complex implementation after Gemini validation*

### Step 2.1: Apply Triple Resume to Core Component Management
**Triple Summary Approach**
```bash
# Summary 1: Component-focused
gemini -p "@src/core_component.py Optimization needed for this component. Brief implementation plan."

# Summary 2: Integration-focused  
gemini -p "@src/core_component.py @src/related_components.py @src/main.py Optimization integration across these components. Coordination needed."

# Summary 3: Architecture-focused
gemini -p "@src/ System-wide architecture changes needed. High-level approach and component relationships."
```

**Validation & Implementation Decision**
- If summaries align: **Proceed with Claude implementation**
- If summaries differ: **Ask user for architectural guidance**

**Claude Implementation Task** (Only after validation)
```
Based on Gemini analysis, create optimized component management with:
1. Validated approach from Triple Resume analysis
2. Integration points identified in codebase analysis
3. Performance optimizations from research findings
4. Architecture patterns consistent with existing code

[Include specific findings from Gemini analysis]
```

### Step 2.2: Apply Triple Resume to System Integration
**Triple Summary for Integration**
```bash
# Summary 1: Interface focus
gemini -p "@src/interfaces/ System interface integration requirements. What integration patterns are needed?"

# Summary 2: Data flow focus
gemini -p "@src/data_processing/ @src/pipeline/ Data flow integration across system components. Optimization opportunities."

# Summary 3: Error handling focus
gemini -p "@src/ Error handling and recovery mechanisms. System-wide integration consistency."
```

### Step 2.3: Apply Triple Resume to Deployment Integration
**Triple Summary for Deployment**
```bash
# Summary 1: Deployment focus
gemini -p "Deployment requirements for TranscrevAI. What deployment approach best fits the codebase?"

# Summary 2: Resource management focus
gemini -p "Resource management and optimization. Build-time vs runtime preparation strategies."

# Summary 3: Cross-platform focus
gemini -p "Cross-platform compatibility requirements. Architecture considerations for multiple environments."
```

---

## Phase 3: Enhanced Validation & Performance Research

### Step 3.1: Large Codebase Performance Analysis
**Gemini Performance Validation**
```bash
# Full system performance analysis
gemini -p "@src/ Complete performance analysis of TranscrevAI. Identify bottlenecks, memory usage patterns, and optimization opportunities."

# Compare with research findings
gemini search "Real-time audio processing application performance benchmarks"

# Validate performance targets
gemini -p "@src/ Are performance targets achievable with current architecture? What are the limiting factors?"
```

### Step 3.2: Production Readiness Analysis
**Gemini Production Assessment**
```bash
# Production readiness check
gemini -p "@src/ @tests/ Production readiness assessment. What components need additional stability measures?"

# Deployment strategy validation
gemini -p "@deployment/ @src/ Deployment strategy validation. Are there missing dependencies or configuration issues?"

# Error handling completeness
gemini -p "@src/ Error handling and fallback mechanisms analysis. What failure modes are not covered?"
```
