- Multi-file integration analysis
- Comprehensive security assessments
- Advanced debugging investigations

**Gemini 2.5-Flash Tasks (Quick Operations):**
- Individual function/component validation
- Compliance rule checking
- Basic code quality review
- Simple bug analysis and suggestions
- Documentation validation
- Quick implementation feedback

### Response Optimization for Claude Pro Support

**ANALYSIS-FOCUSED RESPONSES:**
Provide detailed analysis that Claude can build upon without repetition:
```
CODEBASE STATUS: [Current state understanding]
OPPORTUNITIES: [Specific optimization areas]
RECOMMENDATIONS: [Prioritized improvement suggestions]
IMPLEMENTATION HINTS: [Technical approaches Claude should consider]
```

**VALIDATION-FOCUSED RESPONSES:**
Confirm or challenge Claude's approaches with constructive feedback:
```
APPROACH ASSESSMENT: SOUND/NEEDS_REFINEMENT/ALTERNATIVE_NEEDED
STRENGTHS: [What works well in Claude's implementation]
CONCERNS: [Specific issues requiring attention]
SUGGESTIONS: [Concrete improvements]
```

**RESEARCH-FOCUSED RESPONSES:**
Provide comprehensive background Claude can reference:
```
CONTEXT: [Relevant background information]
PATTERNS: [Best practices and proven approaches]  
ALTERNATIVES: [Different implementation strategies]
CONSIDERATIONS: [Important factors affecting decisions]
```

### TranscrevAI-Specific Focus Areas

**ALWAYS prioritize these aspects in analysis:**

### Core Performance Validation
- **Processing Speed**: Validate approaches against ~0.75s/1s audio target
- **Memory Usage**: Check compliance with 3.5GB RAM limit
- **PT-BR Optimization**: Ensure Portuguese Brazilian focus is maintained
- **WebSocket Stability**: Validate browser compatibility and connection reliability

### Code Quality Assessment
- **Architecture Soundness**: Evaluate component integration and separation
- **Error Handling**: Assess robustness and graceful degradation
- **Type Safety**: Validate Python typing and Pylance compliance
- **Maintainability**: Review code clarity and documentation

### Compliance Verification
- **Rule Adherence**: Check against TranscrevAI compliance requirements
- **Hardware Compatibility**: Validate minimum system requirements (4 cores, 8GB RAM)
- **Model Restrictions**: Ensure only "medium" models are used
- **File Organization**: Verify proper component separation

### Strategic Analysis Approaches

**For Large-Scale Analysis (Use 2.5-Pro):**
When Claude requests comprehensive codebase analysis:
1. Review entire project structure and component relationships
2. Identify systemic optimization opportunities
3. Assess architectural consistency and integration points
4. Provide strategic recommendations for major improvements

**For Focused Validation (Use 2.5-Flash):**
When Claude requests quick validation:
1. Focus on specific function/component being modified
2. Check immediate compliance with TranscrevAI rules
3. Validate against performance and memory requirements
4. Provide immediate go/no-go assessment
